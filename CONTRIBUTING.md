# Contribution Guide

We welcome any and all contributions (bug fixes, features, documentation, tests, etc.).

For non-trivial additions we recommend opening an issue to discuss the change with the team first. For everything else feel free to open a PR directly.

## Process

0. **Read the contributor license agreement**  
All contributors must read and accept the contributor license agreement (CLA) included at the bottom of this document. If you do not accept the CLA, do not submit code to this project. Submitting code to this project only if you have read and agreed to the CLA.

1. **Search**  
Search the [issues page](https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace/issues?q=) for key words related to the change you want to make. Check to see if there has been any previous discussion or work done.

2. **Discuss** (optional for trivial changes)  
Open an issue to discuss non-trivial changes with the team, or to ask for guidance on how to add a feature.

3. **Make a Pull Request**  
Implement the changes and make a pull request. See the "Pull Request Merge Requirements" section below.

4. **Respond to Review**  
A reviewer from our team will look over the code and may have questions or give feedback before merging.

## Pull Request Merge Requirements
If you are unsure about anything, feel free to open an issue or make a pull request anyway. We are happy to help get any contributions merged!

Before a PR is merged it must meet the following requirements:

- Pass all tests
- Add tests covering new functionality
- Follow clang format style guides
- Be approved by relevant code owner

See the developer docs about running and adding tests.

Run clang-format using the `.clang-format` file in the root directory. Most IDE's can be configured to do this automatically.

After opening the PR we will assign the correct reviewer to review the change.

## Developer Workflow

We are tracking what needs to be worked on via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace/issues) and we are tracking what is actively being developed on the [dev board](https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace/projects/1).

If you want to contribute but aren't sure how, look for unassigned issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee) or for un-started issues on the [dev board](https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace/projects/1).

If you find an issue that look interesting feel free to leave a comment to prevent duplicate efforts, or a comment asking for guidance about how to get started.
