## Code Format

Coderrect OpenRace adopts [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with one customization:

```
ColumLimit: 120 // changed from 80 -> 120
```

### Using Clang Format

To enforece the code format when contributing to Coderrect OpenRace, a `.clang-format` file is provided at the root path of the project.

You can integrate it with your editor to enable auto-formatting.

#### VSCode Integration

To use `.clang-format` in Visual Studio Code, first make sure the `.clang-format` is correctly located at the root of the project.
Then change configuration `C_Cpp:Clang_format_style` to `file`.
