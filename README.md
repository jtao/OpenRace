# OpenRace

OpenRace is an in development C/C++ data race detection tool.

This project aims to have a clean and extensible design to facilitate community contributions.

OpenRace is an open source implementation of the [Coderrect Scanner][CS] which is a C/C++/Fortran data race detection tool. The open source tool is currently behind the original scanner in terms of feature support, but we are actively developing and expect OpenRace to eventually replace the closed source implementation of [Coderrect Scanner][CS].

# Building

Using conan to manage dependencies. Instructions to install conan can be found [here](https://conan.io/downloads.html).

To build, run the following:

```
mkdir build && cd build
conan install ..
cmake -DLLVM_DIR=$LLVM_DIR ..
make -j
```

Feel free to adjust cmake options as you see fit.

The only required option is `LLVM_DIR` which should point to the directory containing `LLVMConfig.cmake` for LLVM version 10.0.0 .

# Developing
- Project layout based on [Pitchfork Layout](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/?force=1&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vector-of-bool/pitchfork/develop/data/spec.bs)

- CMake guidelines based off of [Effective Modern CMake](https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1)

- Conan usage based on Conan's [CMake Docs](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/integrations/build_system/cmake/cmake_generator.html)
